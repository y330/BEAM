# Brain Scan Enhancer Assitive Model

HOW WILL THE PROGRAM BE CREATED?

The program will detect and mark the tumor directly from the brain scans using Python, Machine Learning, OpenCV, and Numpy.  The Program Can be Found Here (Click here)



WHAT ARE ITS ADVANTAGES?

As discussed above, The application utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans to automatically detect the majority of tumors. Also, those that go undetected and lead to the patient's uncertain demise.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

The program accepts the brain scan from one end and sends the enhanced brain scan with tumor visible, which will make it easier for the doctor to plan the course of action.


WHY THIS?

This program is easy to run which means any medical specialist can use it at their convenience anytime anywhere.
It will help thousands of people all over the world by bringing reform in the history of Medicines.


HOW SOON CAN IT BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY?

The software must be accessible and convenient to use for all, this further concludes that  the only challenge will be to integrate it with MRI run efficiently; once resolved, it will be up and running in no time. Before it is used for professional reasons, it should also be assessed with certain real-life scenarios.
